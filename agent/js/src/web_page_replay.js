/**
 * Controls WebPageReplay for this particular browser via an command script.
 * The script, usually named 'wpr', must accept the following commands:
 *
 * wpr record <IP or MAC>  -- Start recording all HTTP from the IP/MAC.
 *     Before the recording, delete any leftover recordings for the IP/MAC.
 *     Set up any DNS spoofing, if applicable, start WPR in recording mode.
 *     Save the recording, so that "wpr replay" would pick it up.
 * wpr replay <IP or MAC>  -- Start replaying recorded HTTP from the IP/MAC.
 *     Start WPR in replay mode, with a recording from "wpr record".
 * wpr getlog <IP or MAC>  -- Print replay error log for the IP/MAC to stdout.
 *     Any errors in the log induce a run failure. Therefore if you want to
 *     tolerate request pass-throughs, those must be warnings, not errors.
 *     Reset the log, so that the next "wpr getlog" for this IP/MAC would only
 *     return the log from this point on.
 * wpr stop <IP or MAC>  -- Stop record/replay for the IP/MAC.
 *     Delete the recording, if any, and undo any DNS spoofing, if any.
 *     Must tolerate
 * At the job level, record/replay works as follows, when the job specifies it:
 *
 * 1. Run #0 for recording:
 * 1.1. Command "wpr record <IP or MAC>".
 * 1.2. Unconditionally NO traffic shaping, NO video capture, even if the job
 *     specified video capture or traffic shaping.
 * 1.3. Only an uncached run, no cache-warm run even if the job specified it.
 * 1.4. Do NOT submit run #0 results to the WebPageTest server,
 *     unless it's a failure, in which case the whole job fails, go to (3).
 * 1.5. Kill wd_server and kill leftover processes as usual.
 *     This may kill any background children of the wpr script, if launched.
 *
 * At the end of (1), there is a recording available of the run #0.
 *
 * 2. Real runs #1-N, with traffic shaping, video, etc. as specified by the job.
 * 2.1. Command "wpr replay <IP or MAC>".
 * 2.2. The run as usual, with or without cache-warm run, as the job specifies.
 * 2.3. Command "wpr getlog <IP or MAC>".
 * 2.4. Send results to the WebPageTest server.
 * 2.4. Kill wd_server and leftover processes, including any children of wpr.
 *
 * 3. At the very end, with traffic shaping reset, stop WebPageReplay:
 * 3.1. Command "wpr stop <IP or MAC>".
 *
 * (3.1) has a chance to nuke the recording from run #0.
 *
 * If the job does not specify WebPageReplay, we just run the command:
 * "wpr stop <IP or MAC>"
 * in case the previous run somehow failed to do that.
